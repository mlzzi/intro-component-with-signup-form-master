## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass

### What I learned

In this project the Javascript was a real challenge. Despite being a simple task for a developer, as a starter it gave me real work to put to work. But I'm satisfied with the result.
Puting all together, HTML, CSS and Javascript, made me happy.

### Continued development

My journey with Javascript is in the beginning, and much more are to come. I want to make the foundations real solid before take a step ahead to React JS.
